This step is very important especially when we arrive at modeling the data in order to apply Machine learning. Plotting in EDA consists of Histograms, Box plot, Scatter plot and many more. It often takes much time to explore the data. Through the process of EDA, we can ask to define the problem statement or definition on our data set which is very important."

To give a piece of brief information about the data set this data contains more of 10, 000 rows and more than 10 columns which contains features of the car such as Engine Fuel Type, Engine HP, Transmission Type, highway MPG, city MPG and many more. So in this tutorial, we will explore the data and make it ready for modeling."

No need to mount to the google drive or use any specific libraries just upload the data set and your job is done. One thing to remember in this step is that uploaded files will get deleted when this runtime is recycled. This is how I got the data set into the notebook."
